# Web UI

Moogla ships with a small browser interface located in `src/moogla/web`.
Start the server and navigate to `/app` to use it:

```bash
moogla serve
# then open http://localhost:11434/app
```

Double click a chat bubble to copy its text. Use the darkâ€‘mode toggle in
the header to switch themes.
